## NBA Points Prediction Model
Overview
This project develops a heuristic model to estimate the number of points an NBA player will score in a game, specifically using minutes played (MIN) and assists dished (AST) as the key indicators. The model incorporates expert-driven rules and historical data analysis to predict player performance effectively.

Data
The dataset features player performance metrics from NBA games, focusing on minutes played, assists, and points scored. This data is used to establish benchmarks and heuristic rules that guide the prediction logic.

Model
Our heuristic model applies predefined rules derived from historical trends and expert insights. It considers how varying minutes and assists typically impact a player's scoring potential. The model is designed to quickly generate points predictions based on anticipated game-day statistics.
